## 1. Bionium-X
**Bionium-X** is a research-grade, AI-based open-source platform designed to detect potential biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres using transmission and emission spectral data. By parsing highly-dimensional signals from orbital telescopes, the system probabilistically estimates the presence of critical biological precursors—thereby advancing the automated search for extraterrestrial life.

## 2. Overview and Scientific Motivation
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other upcoming observatories are producing unprecedented volumes of exoplanetary spectral data. Manual interpretation of these noisy signals is computationally bottlenecked. **Bionium-X** introduces an automated machine learning pipeline that filters instrumental noise, standardizes wavelength grids, and applies deep representation learning to identify molecular absorption features of key gases:
* **Oxygen (O₂)** and **Ozone (O₃)**
* **Methane (CH₄)**
* **Water Vapor (H₂O)**
* **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**

The primary scientific motivation is to identify instances of **Atmospheric Chemical Disequilibrium** (e.g., the simultaneous presence of O₂ and CH₄), which on terrestrial exoplanets serves as a strong proxy for continuously active biological processes.

## 3. Key Features
* **Spectral Ingestion Engine**: Natively parses FITS, HDF5, and CSV datasets from leading astronomical databases.
* **Physics-Informed Noise Modeling**: Simulates instrumental signatures (JWST NIRSpec, Hubble WFC3) and stellar flare injections to rigorously evaluate model robustness.
* **Deep Learning Classifiers**: Rapid inference utilizing optimized 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Spectral Transformers.
* **Habitability Scoring System**: Integrates thermodynamic constraints (Equilibrium Temperature, Planetary Radius) with AI probabilistic outputs to score overall biological viability.

## 4. Scientific Background
### Transit Spectroscopy and Biosignatures
When an exoplanet transits its host star, a fraction of the starlight passes through the planet's atmosphere. Specific atmospheric molecules absorb light at characteristic wavelengths, producing a unique **Transmission Spectrum**.

A single atmospheric gas is rarely indicative of life. However, combinations of highly reactive gases that rapidly destroy each other (such as Methane and Oxygen) violate thermodynamic equilibrium. Unless replenished by geologic or continuous biological processes (like photosynthesis and methanogenesis), these combinations would not persist. Bionium-X identifies these disequilibrium thresholds.

## 5. System Architecture
The system architecture encompasses a multi-stage pipeline from raw photon flux processing to final classification.

## 7. Installation Instructions
This system is strictly validated for Unix/macOS environments running Python 3.8+.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/Bionium-X.git
cd Bionium-X

# Initialize virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 8. Usage Instructions with Example Output
You can run inference programmatically or via the included interactive Streamlit dashboard.

**Launching the Dashboard:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Programmatic Inference Example:**
```python
from src.data.preprocessing import preprocess_pipeline
from src.models.cnn_1d import CNN1DModel
import torch

# Load theoretical spectrum
wavelengths, raw_flux = load_spectrum('data/raw/K2-18b_transmission.csv')
clean_wave, clean_flux = preprocess_pipeline(wavelengths, raw_flux)

# Initialize loaded model
model = CNN1DModel(input_length=1000, num_classes=5)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('saved_models/cnn_model.pth', map_location='cpu'))
model.eval()

# Predict probabilities
tensor_flux = torch.tensor(clean_flux, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)
predictions = model(tensor_flux).squeeze().detach().numpy()

print(f"O2: {predictions[0]:.2f}, CH4: {predictions[1]:.2f}")
# Output: O2: 0.88, CH4: 0.91 -> High Disequilibrium!
```

## 9. Dataset Sources
Bionium-X aligns its data structures with and is validated against leading global databases:
* [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/): Primary source for exoplanet radii, equilibrium temperatures, and stellar parameters.
* [ExoMol Database](https://www.exomol.com/): Definitive source for comprehensive molecular line lists required to generate accurate synthetic spectra.
* [HITRAN](https://hitran.org/): High-resolution transmission molecular absorption database utilized for benchmarking Earth-like baseline atmospheric compositions.

## 10. Machine Learning Models Used
1. **Random Forest (Baseline)**: Established as a robust control threshold, operating on explicitly extracted tabular features (equivalent width, line depths).
2. **1D Convolutional Neural Network (Primary)**: Engineered to parse sequential array structure of 1D spectroscopic data, leveraging local receptive fields to identify variable-width absorption dips unaffected by mild red-shifts.
3. **Spectral Transformer**: In experimental deployment; utilizes multi-head attention blocks to capture long-range dependencies between distant molecular resonant signatures (e.g., assessing O₂ at 0.76 µm correlated dynamically with O₃ at 9.6 µm).

## 11. Evaluation Metrics
Models are benchmarked using typical multi-label classification standards:
* **F1-Macro Score**: Ensuring uniform performance regardless of molecule abundance distributions in the training set.
* **ROCAUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)**: Evaluating certainty curves against background baseline noise injections.
* **Inference Latency**: Critical for scalability; the current 1D CNN achieves `< 15ms` per spectrum on standard CPU environments.

## 12. Example Visualizations
*(Note: Within the application, dynamic Plotly views are generated.)*

When utilizing Bionium-X, researchers have access to:
1. **Explainable AI Overlays**: Highlights the exact absorption vectors (e.g., 1.4 µm H₂O) triggering the model's confidence logic.
2. **Radar Charts**: Depicting normalized strength across the 5 primary atmospheric compounds.

## 13. Roadmap / Future Work
- [ ] Stabilize the **FITS extraction pipeline** to handle raw Hubble WFC3 spatial scans out-of-the-box.
- [ ] Deploy **Spectral Transformer V2**, expanding classes to include novel biosignatures like Phosphine (PH₃) and Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS).
- [ ] Integrate **Bayesian Neural Networks** to natively provide true scientific uncertainty metrics alongside point predictions.
